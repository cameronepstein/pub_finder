# Pub Finder

A single page web application which allows users to find nearby pubs in either London or Belfast using the Google Maps API.

### User Stories

* As a user, so that I can choose between two destinations, I would like to be able to search for pubs in London and Belfast.

* As a user, so that I can see where pubs are located, I would like to see a pin over each pub on Google Maps.

* As a user, so that Google Maps does not get too cluttered, I would like no more than 100 pins to show at any given time.
